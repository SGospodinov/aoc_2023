# Advent of Code 2023 ðŸŽ„

Will be doing it in TypeScript this year. Probably will give up after day 3.


## Instructions

Install dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```


Run daily puzzle

```bash
yarn ts-node puzzles/day{}_part{}.ts
```

## Notes

- Day 5, part 2 is works but it's quite slow, consider optimising
